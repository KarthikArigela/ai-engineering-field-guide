# AI Use Cases Analysis

Based on 24,502 extracted use cases from 4,894 job descriptions across six monthly scrapes (Feb-Jun 2026).

Methodology note: I collected all use cases into a single file and used AI (Claude) to analyze and categorize them. This is not a quantitative analysis like the [skills analysis](02-skills.md) (see the [analysis notebook](../job-market/analysis.ipynb) for that) - it's based on the questions I asked and the patterns Claude identified in the data. The category counts come from keyword matching, so a single use case can count toward more than one category, and the percentages below are mentions divided by the 24,502 total. It may be less precise than a strict statistical analysis, but I believe it's still representative of what's happening in the market.

## Summary

The use cases reveal what companies are actually building with AI today. This is the real-world application landscape that AI Engineers work on daily.

Total use cases extracted: 24,502

- AI-First roles: 18,167 use cases (74.1%)
- AI-Support roles: 5,799 use cases (23.7%)
- ML-First and unclassified roles: 536 use cases (2.2%)


## Feb vs Jun: How the Market Shifted

Comparing the first scrape (Feb 2026, 895 jobs, 4,525 use cases) with the latest (Jun 2026, 888 jobs, 4,292 use cases) shows what companies are shifting toward. The AI-First share rose from 69.4% to 75.9%.

Automation, enterprise operations, and retrieval pulled further ahead, while personalization and customer-facing Q&A declined.

Biggest movers (change is in percentage points of jobs):

| Use case | Feb | Jun | Change |
|----------|-----|-----|--------|
| Internal and Enterprise Operations | 50.6% | 64.2% | +13.6 |
| Automating Manual Workflows | 62.2% | 72.9% | +10.6 |
| Finding Information (RAG/Search) | 39.4% | 49.4% | +10.0 |
| Agentic Systems | 48.5% | 55.3% | +6.8 |
| Deploying AI to Production | 42.3% | 49.1% | +6.8 |
| Personalizing Experiences | 18.0% | 8.6% | -9.4 |
| Answering Customer Questions | 40.1% | 32.4% | -7.7 |
| Creating Content at Scale | 38.9% | 36.3% | -2.6 |

What this tells me:

- The top three use cases all grew by double digits. Automation is now in 72.9% of jobs, and internal enterprise operations - risk, compliance, fraud, claims - is close behind at 64.2%.
- Retrieval crossed toward half of all jobs (49.4%). Connecting LLMs to proprietary data is now standard, not niche.
- Agentic systems became a majority use case (55.3%), matching the rise of agents in responsibilities.
- Personalization fell the most (-9.4 points) and customer-facing Q&A declined too. The center of gravity is moving from consumer-facing features toward internal automation and enterprise operations.

## Key Insights

### 1. Automation is the Primary Use Case

The most common problem AI solves is automating manual workflows - 5,848 mentions (23.9%), appearing in 69.0% of jobs. This is not glamorous; it's about reducing repetitive work, coordinating processes, and handling scale.

### 2. Enterprise Operations Are Nearly as Large

Internal operational efficiency is the second biggest category at 21.3% - risk, compliance, revenue operations, fraud, and claims. Enterprise AI is a dominant theme, not a niche.

### 3. Agents Went Mainstream

Agentic systems account for 15.5% of use cases and appear in 49.4% of jobs. Roughly half of all postings now describe multi-agent, tool-using systems - a clear shift from the earlier "single LLM call" pattern.

### 4. Knowledge Access is Universal

Every domain has the same problem: too much information, cannot find what's needed. RAG and semantic search solve this across healthcare (medical literature), finance (regulations), legal (contracts), and general enterprise (internal docs).

### 5. Customer Support is a Major Driver

Customer-facing solutions are 11.2% of use cases because they directly impact revenue and customer satisfaction. The ROI is clear: reduce support costs while improving response times.

### 6. Production is Hard

13.7% of use cases focus on deployment infrastructure. This reflects the real challenge of getting AI models from notebooks to production reliably.

### 7. Domain Specialization is Niche but High-Value

Only 1.0% of use cases involve fine-tuned models for specific domains (insurance, legal, cybersecurity, fintech). Few in number, but they represent high-value applications where generic models are insufficient.
