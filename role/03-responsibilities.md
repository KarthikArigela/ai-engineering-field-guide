# AI Engineering Responsibilities Analysis

Based on 33,957 responsibilities extracted from 4,894 job descriptions across six monthly scrapes (Feb-Jun 2026).

Methodology note: I collected all responsibilities into a single file and used AI (Claude) to analyze and categorize them. This is not a quantitative analysis like the [skills analysis](02-skills.md) (see the [analysis notebook](../job-market/analysis.ipynb) for that) - it's based on the questions I asked and the patterns Claude identified in the data. The prevalence numbers (percent of jobs) come from keyword matching, so a single responsibility can count toward more than one category. It may be less precise than a strict statistical analysis, but I believe it's still representative of what's happening in the market.

Across all 33,957 responsibilities:

- AI-First roles: 24,905 responsibilities (73.4%)
- AI-Support roles: 8,254 responsibilities (24.3%)
- ML-First and unclassified roles: 798 responsibilities (2.4%)


## Feb vs Jun: How the Market Shifted

Comparing the first scrape (Feb 2026, 895 jobs) with the latest (Jun 2026, 888 jobs) shows a clear direction. Postings got denser - 6.4 to 7.3 responsibilities per job - and tilted more AI-First, from 69.4% to 75.9% of roles.

The role is becoming more agentic and more operational, and less exploratory. Agents crossed into the majority of jobs, while research dropped sharply.

Biggest movers (change is in percentage points of jobs):

| Area | Feb | Jun | Change |
|------|-----|-----|--------|
| Agents and Agentic Workflows | 41.8% | 54.8% | +13.1 |
| Security, Safety and Compliance | 35.5% | 44.9% | +9.4 |
| Monitoring and Maintenance | 61.6% | 70.6% | +9.0 |
| Data and Pipelines | 42.6% | 50.0% | +7.4 |
| Integrating APIs and Services | 60.4% | 66.6% | +6.1 |
| Research and Experimentation | 43.1% | 30.1% | -13.1 |
| Customer and Client Work | 33.5% | 26.7% | -6.8 |
| Fine-tuning and Training | 15.4% | 12.0% | -3.4 |

What this tells me:

- Agents went from a common responsibility to a majority one in five months. 54.8% of AI Engineer postings now describe agentic work.
- Production concerns grew - monitoring and security both rose around 9 points, reinforcing that the work is maturing from prototypes toward reliable, governed systems.
- Research fell the most (-13.1 points). Fewer roles are framed around exploration and prototyping; more are framed around shipping and operating.
- Customer-facing and fine-tuning responsibilities continued to decline, consistent with the broader pattern that the core job is building and running systems rather than client services or model training.


## Frequency Guide

I measured each responsibility area by how many of the 4,894 job descriptions it appears in, not just raw mention counts. A responsibility in 98.1% of jobs is genuinely universal; one in 2.5% is niche.

| Prevalence | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| Very common | Appears in a majority of descriptions (over 50%) |
| Common | Appears in many descriptions (25.0-50.0%) |
| Uncommon | Appears in some descriptions (15.0-25.0%) |
| Rare | Appears in few descriptions (under 15.0%) |

- Low latency needs - on-premise for edge or regional requirements
- Custom models - fine-tuned models that you host yourself


## Key Insights

### 1. Building is the Primary Responsibility

Building systems appears in 98.1% of jobs. AI Engineers are builders first and foremost.

### 2. Production is a Major Responsibility

When you combine deployment (78.3%), monitoring (64.3%), and infrastructure (69.2%), productionizing AI is most of the work - much larger than initially apparent.

### 3. Quality is Not Optional

Evaluation and quality appear in 68.5% of jobs. AI Engineers are expected to build systems that work reliably and safely.

### 4. APIs and Integration Dominate Over Self-Hosting

Integrating APIs and services appears in 62.4% of jobs, while self-hosting models appears in only 2.5%. The market overwhelmingly uses provider APIs rather than running its own inference infrastructure.

### 5. RAG and Agents are Mainstream

RAG/retrieval (42.0%) and agents (48.4%) are now standard responsibilities, not niche. Roughly half of all AI Engineers work on agentic systems.

### 6. Fine-tuning is Uncommon

Despite the hype, fine-tuning appears in only 13.8% of jobs and prompt engineering in 10.0%. Most roles use existing models with RAG, prompting, and integration rather than training or tuning.
